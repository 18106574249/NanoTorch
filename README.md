# NeuraNet

**NeuraNet** is a deep learning library (mini framework) inspired by the PyTorch framework, which 
I created using only **Math** and **Numpy** :). My purpose here is not to create a powerful deep 
learning framework (maybe in the future), but solely to understand how deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow work behind the scenes.
