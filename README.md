# NeuraNet

**NeuraNet** is deep learning library (mini frameworks) inspired from PyTorch framework, I create using
only **Math** and **Numpy** :). My purpose here not create a powerful deep learning framework (maybe in the 
future), but the only reason is more understand how deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow work 
behind the scenes.
